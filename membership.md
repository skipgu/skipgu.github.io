## SKIP Student Association Structure Overview

The SKIP Student Association operates in collaboration with Göta Studentkår and is designed to enhance the student experience by organizing events. To effectively achieve its mission, SKIP comprises two distinct categories of members: "Board Members" and "Regular Members." It's important to note that all members, both board and regular, must also be members of Göta Studentkår.

  - Leadership: Board members are entrusted with leadership roles that enable them to make strategic decisions and drive the direction of SKIP.

2. **Regular Members:**
  - Supportive Role: Regular members form an essential part of SKIP by actively participating in events and providing valuable feedback. They assist in the successful execution of activities initiated by board members.
  - Benefits: Regular members enjoy additional perks such as priority access to events, discounts, and the opportunity to engage in the SKIP community.
  - Contributors: Their insights and contributions are integral to ensuring that events cater to the needs and preferences of the student body.



### Collaboration
Board members and regular members work collaboratively to bring meaningful experiences to the broader student community. The synergy between these two categories of members, all of whom are also members of Göta Studentkår, is essential for the association's success.

The structure of SKIP, with board members at its core and regular members as active contributors, ensures a well-rounded approach to event management, making it possible to offer valuable experiences to students, enhancing their academic journey within Göta Studentkår.
