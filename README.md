In order to run locally, make sure to install jekyll according to instructions https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

run

`bundle install`

followed by

`bundle exec jekyll serve --config "_config.yml,_config_local.yml"`

The _config_local.yml file overrides the url, and makes it so the website is served locally.
