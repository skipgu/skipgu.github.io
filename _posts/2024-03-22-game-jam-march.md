### SKIP is presenting to you an exciting opportunity at Lindholmen &#128640;

&#128165; In this Game Jam, you get to make a game based on a certain theme in just a
few days! After submitting your game there will be a panel of judges who will
vote on the games and you compete for exciting prizes! &#128165;

&#128073; This event is **free** and **no experience** in game development is needed!

Are you new to game development and don't think you can finish a game in such a
short amount of time? Well, give it a shot anyway, it's worth a try and you'll
most certainly learn a lot!
Moreover, we have a *"get started"* **collection of helpful resources** prepared for
you [here](https://github.com/skipgu/GameJam-get-started)! &#128218;

&#128206; Please, note there are no limits to the type of game you can create
for the jam, **as long as it fits the theme**!
> Some examples could be computer games, VR games, AR games, boardgames,
cardgames, an interactive experience, interactive stories, and so forth.
