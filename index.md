## SKIP - Student Association


SKIP was founded in 1989 by a group of System Science students at the IT Faculty of the University of Gothenburg. Our mission is to offer students opportunities to socialize with people from different programs as a way to create an informal learning environment, where knowledge in IT can be shared.
