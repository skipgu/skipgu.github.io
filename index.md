## SKIP - Student Association

SKIP, which stands for **"The Student Association for Knowledge in Informatics and Programming",** is a vibrant community dedicated to enriching the academic and social experiences of students at the **IT faculty of Gothenburg University.**

SKIP was founded in 1989 by a group of System Science students at the IT Faculty of the University of Gothenburg. Our mission is to offer students opportunities to socialize with people from different programs as a way to create an informal learning environment, where knowledge in IT can be shared.

The primary objective of SKIP is to deliver events that enhance the study experience of students within Göta Studentkår. By organizing diverse, engaging, and impactful events, SKIP aims to create a vibrant and supportive student community, where academic and personal growth are fostered.
