<p>SKIP, which stands for <b>"The student Association for Knowledge in Informatics and Programming",</b> is a vibrant community dedicated to enriching the academic and social experiences of students at the <b>IT faculty of Gothenburg University.</b></p>

<p>SKIP was founded in 1989 by a group of System Science students at the IT Faculty of the University of Gothenburg. Our mission is to offer students opportunities to socialize with people from different programs as a way to create an informal learning environment, where knowledge in IT can be shared.</p>

<p>The primary objective of SKIP is to deliver events that enhance the study experience of students within Göta Studentkår. By organizing diverse, engaging, and impactful events, SKIP aims to create a vibrant and supportive student community, where academic and personal growth are fostered.</p>
